For any new article -> Create a new .md file under the 'articles' folder.  
For any images to be used within a .md file -> Add the image under the 'images' directory and refer to it using relative path in .md  

** Last Step **
Add an entry for the new .md file in index.md file; so it can show up at https://pkuma-msft.github.io/azure-test-plans/
